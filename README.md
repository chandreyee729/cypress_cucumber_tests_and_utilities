# cypress_extended_tests_and_utilities
This repository provides a well-structured Cypress testing framework designed for scalable behavorial-driven-testing and integration testing. 


- This project uses the [GoREST API](https://gorest.co.in/) â€” a powerful, free RESTful service for testing HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. It provides dummy users, posts, comments, and more, making it ideal for end-to-end and API automation testing scenarios.
Go to given link and generate an API token for personal use.

- This project uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) - an open-source Firebase alternative that provides instant APIs, authentication, and a Postgres database. In this project, Supabase is leveraged for handling user authentication and role-based access control, enabling secure and scalable testing environments.
Go to Supabase, signup, create a project. use Project reference and sign up using curl:

```curl --location 'https://${{project_reference_no}}$.supabase.co/auth/v1/signup' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'apikey: ${{your_api_key}}' \
--data-raw '{
  "email": "${{useremail}}",
  "password": "${{userPassword}}"
}'```

> Ideal for QA Engineers and SDETs who want reusable, modular, and CI/CD-ready Cypress test automation.

This project includes:
- [x] Framework with BDD approach using Cucumber (Feature files in Gherkin syntax)
